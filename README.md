# Advent of Code 2021

Goals:
- do a 50/50 split of solving with [Nim](nim-lang.org) and Racket
- stick to a 1h timebox and see how far that gets me
- exercise TDD as much as possible
- quick runtime efficiency analysis of solutions

## Nim
Run with
```
nim c -r <nim file>
```

Read doc comments in a nicer way

```
nim doc <file>.nim
open htmldocs/<file>.html
```
